# Computation Graph Viz

Computation Graph Viz is a visualization for computation graphs and backpropagation.
It was my final project for the Education Technology class in [Georgia Tech's Online Master of Science in Computer Science program](https://omscs.gatech.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
The project is built with React, D3, Math.js and MathJax.
The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/kcdragon/computation-graph-viz){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
